# JaJang
A solution for restaurants management and food-ordering.   
Website: https://www.jajang.cloud    
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.7.4.   
## Description
We designed an online order platform named Jajang.Cloud. It
is a platform which provide interfaces for both merchants and customers. For
merchants, they can register for their own restaurants and upload their menus.
Regardless of dine in or delivery, our platform can help the merchants deal with
customers any request and reply with corresponding response. It can save both
time and space for the merchants. And for customers, they can order a deliv-
ery online via our platform, or order food and ask for service when dinning in the
restaurant by scanning a QR code that the merchant get from our platform. So our
purpose is to provide convenience for both merchants and customers.
